It also supplies some functions to manipulate it's usual behavior.\r\n\r\n### How can I use it?\r\nWell, first you must ensure to include jQuery, the fast and concise JavaScript library, and the DisplayRotate.js file:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"displayRotate.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNext you need to initialize DisplayRotate. The easiest and quickest way to do this is as follows:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  $(document).ready(function(){\r\n    $(\"#your_display_container\").displayRotate();\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The end - for now!\r\nThis page is under construction.
